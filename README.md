# Web-Scraping

Built a pyhton code to extract data from the web page and automatically entering them into a csv file that we created in local system.


In this case we have extracted a data from a popular e-commerce website called Flipkart ["https://www.flipkart.com/search?q=apple+smart+watch&sid=ajy%2Cbuh&as=on&as-show=on&otracker=AS_QueryStore_OrganicAutoSuggest_2_19_na_na_ps&otracker1=AS_QueryStore_OrganicAutoSuggest_2_19_na_na_ps&as-pos=2&as-type=RECENT&suggestionId=apple+smart+watch%7CSmart+Watches&requestId=ef743f4b-409b-48de-87ef-ee16a9709bf9&as-searchtext=apple%20smart%20watches"].
Bunch of iphone watches data(Product name, Price, Ratings) and stored in "products.csv" file.


#Extracting info from websites, Sounds Awesome ;)
